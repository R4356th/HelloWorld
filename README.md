# Hello World!
This repository contains my collection of code in different languages to print out "Hello World!", printing out which has been a programming convention since 1978. You can read [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to learn more about the convention.
